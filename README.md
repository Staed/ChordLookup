# ChordLookup
This is a Python version implementation for Chord Loop up algorithm in distributed system. 
It is bounded to 256 nodes maximum in the same network. 
The implementation had been tested in one machine simulated network environment. 
The implementation used UDP as transmission protocal and different thread controlled ports to mimic a real network situtation.
